                        Optimization is the process by which a quantity of interest is maximized or minimized. 
                        Examples of optimization problems include maximizing volume, 
                        minimizing surface area, minimizing materials used, minimizing time, and maximizing profit. 
                        It is a mathematical procedure that applies absolute extrema, which we covered in section
                        <a href="3.4.html" style="color:plum">3.4</a>, to real-world problems. 
                        The emphasis on efficiency in the everyday world cultivates the need for optimization in a wide range of applications, 
                        including geometry, finance, and science. 
                        In this section, we will discuss the strategy for solving these problems and reveal their diverse uses.
                    </p>

                            <p>
                                To understand the problem, let us experiment with some possibilities: 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        If \(a = 13\) and \(b = 1,\) then their product is \(13.\)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        If \(a = 12\) and \(b = 2,\) then their product is \(24.\)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        If \(a = 11\) and \(b = 3,\) then their product is \(33.\)
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                The right combination of \(a\) and \(b\) maximizes the product \(P = ab\) 
                                while adhering to the condition that \(a + b = 14.\) 
                                Thus, we can write equations that express these qualities; 
                                this procedure of modeling the problem is the key step in optimization problems.
                                We have the requirement that \(a\) and \(b\) add up to \(14 \!:\)
                                <div class="numbered-equations">
                                    <p>
                                        \(\ds a + b = 14.\)
                                        <span> \((1)\) </span>
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                                We also know that
                                <div class="numbered-equations">
                                    <p>
                                        \(\ds P = ab.\)
                                        <span> \((2)\) </span>
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                                From equation \((1),\) we can derive an expression for \(b,\)
                                \[a + b = 14 \implies b = 14 - a,\]
                                and plug it into equation \((2).\) 
                                Doing so produces
                                \[P = ab = a(14 - a).\]
                                (We could have also derived an expression for \(a\) from equation \((1)\) 
                                and written \(P\) in terms of \(b.\))
                                The objective of this algebraic manipulation is to obtain an expression for 
                                our quantity of interest, \(P,\) solely in terms of a single variable, \(a.\) 
                                Thus, we can now write \(P\) as \(P(a).\) 
                                We wish to maximize the value of \(P(a),\) so we must find its critical points. 
                                Calculating the derivative, \(P'(a),\) and equating it to \(0\) give
                                \[
                                \ba 
                                P'(a) = 14 - 2a &= 0 \\
                                a &= 7.
                                \ea 
                                \]
                                We now need to justify whether \(a = 7\) corresponds to a relative maximum,
                                relative minimum, or neither. For \(a \lt 7,\) \(P' \gt 0;\) 
                                for \(a \gt 7,\) \(P' \lt 0.\)
                                Because \(P'(a)\) changes sign from positive to negative at \(a = 7,\) 
                                the First Derivative Test states that \(a = 7\) is the location of a relative maximum.
                                We know that this value corresponds to an absolute maximum if we consider extreme cases: 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        For \(a \lt 0,\) it follows that \(b \gt 0\) and \(P \lt 0.\) 
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        For \(a \gt 14,\) it follows that \(b \lt 0\) and \(P \lt 0.\) 
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                Because \(P \to -\infty\) as \(a \to -\infty\) or \(a \to \infty,\) 
                                the relative maximum must be the absolute maximum.
                                <!--figure 1-->
                                <div class="fig-1">
                                    <img src="../images/Calculus/3/3.8/3.8-1.jpg" class="fig-1__image" alt="">
                                </div>
                                Alternatively, we could have noticed that \(P''(a) = -2\) \(\lt 0,\) 
                                indicating that \(P\) is concave down and the local maximum at \(a = 7\) must be an absolute maximum.
                                If we graph the function \(P(a) = a(14 - a),\) 
                                then we notice that the point \((7, 49)\) is the vertex of the downward-opening parabola. (See Figure 1.)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thus, for \(a = 7,\) \(b = 14 - 7 = 7\) and \(P = 49.\) 
                                We conclude that \(\boxed{a = 7 \; \textrm{and} \; b = 7}\) maximize the product \(P.\)

                        Often, the most difficult step is understanding the problem and setting up equations.

                        We have many options for justifying that a certain point is an absolute minimum or maximum. 
                        After finding critical numbers, we can use the First Derivative Test or the Second Derivative Test to determine 
                        whether each one corresponds to a relative minimum or maximum. 
                        We can then consider the endpoints—either analytically, numerically, or graphically—to 
                        determine the location of the absolute minimum or maximum.

                                With optimization problems, it is always useful to create a quick sketch, as shown by Figure 2.
                                For this problem, let \(w\) denote the width of the pen and let \(\ell\) denote the length. 
                                Also let \(A\) be the area of the pen. 
                                These suggestive variables facilitate understanding and avoid confusion.

                                Rearranging equation \((1),\) we get \(\ell = 40 - 2w.\) 
                                We can substitute this expression into equation \((2)\) to acquire
                                \[ A = w \ell = w(40 - 2w). \]
                                We now have a function of \(A\) composed solely of \(w\), 
                                so we can take its derivative to find its critical numbers: 
                                \[ \frac{\dd A}{\dd w} = 40 - 4w = 0 \implies w = 10. \]

                            <p>
                                We know that \(0 \leq w \leq 20 \), 
                                so we need to find the absolute maximum of \(A\) for all \(x\) in that interval. 
                                The absolute maximum either lies at the endpoints of the interval or at its critical points. 
                                By the First Derivative Test, \(w = 10\) corresponds to a relative maximum of \(A\) because 
                                the sign of \(\dd A/ \dd w\) changes from positive to negative at that point.
                                Conversely, at the endpoints, \(w = 0\) and \(w = 20,\) \(A = 0\) because the pen collapses into a straight line. 
                                 
                                Thus, \(w = 10\) must correspond to the absolute maximum of \(A.\)   
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For \(w = 10,\) we have \(\ell = 20.\)
                                Thus, a pen with dimensions \(20\) feet by \(10\) feet produces the maximum area, \(200\) square feet.

                        In the scope of a calculus class, the variety in optimization problems is limited;
                        instructors usually present the same types of problems.

                                We need to understand the problem by visualizing the scenario,
                                so our first step is to sketch a picture. (See Figure 4.)
                                To minimize the cost of manufacturing the can, we need to minimize the surface area. 
                                The surface area of a cylinder of radius \(r\) and height \(h\) is given by

                                (The bases of the cylinder are circles of area \(\pi r^2,\) 
                                and it is wrapped by a rectangular sheet of area \(2 \pi r h.\))

                            <p>
                                We also know that the expression for the volume of the cylinder is 
                                <div class="numbered-equations">
                                    <p>

                                Our goal is to express the surface area, \(S,\) in terms of solely one variable. 
                                This arrangement will enable us to find its minimum by differentiating and analyzing the critical numbers.
                                From equation \((2),\) we have
                                \[40 = \pi r^2 h \implies h = \frac{40}{\pi r^2},\]
                                which we can plug into equation \((1)\) to get 
                                \[
                                \ba 
                                S &= 2 \pi r^2 + 2 \pi r \left(\frac{40}{\pi r^2}\right) \\
                                &= 2 \pi r^2 + \frac{80}{r}.
                                \ea 
                                \] 
                                We can now differentiate this expression and equate it to \(0\) in order to find its critical points. 
                                Doing so yields
                                \[
                                \ba

                                4 \pi r^3 &= 80 \\ 
                                r &= \sqrt[3]{\frac{20}{\pi}}. \\
                                \ea 
                                \]

                                </div>

                                We now need to determine whether this critical number corresponds to a relative minimum, relative maximum, or neither.
                                For \(r \lt \sqrt[3]{20/\pi},\) \(S' \lt 0;\) for \(r \gt \sqrt[3]{20/\pi},\) \(S' \gt 0.\)
                                Because \(S'\) changes sign from negative to positive at the critical number \(r = \sqrt[3]{20/\pi},\) 
                                it corresponds to a relative minimum by the First Derivative Test. 
                                Additionally, since \(\lim_{r \to 0^+} S(r) = \infty\) and \(\lim_{r \to \infty} S(r) = \infty,\)
                                there needs to be a minimum value of \(S(r),\) which must exist at the critical number. (See Figure 5.)
                                This analysis confirms that \(r = \sqrt[3]{20/\pi}\) is the absolute minimum of \(S(r).\) 
                                We then have \(r \approx 1.853\) \(\textrm{in.}\) and
                                \[h = \frac{40}{\pi (20/\pi)^{2/3}} \approx 3.707 \; \textrm{in.}\]
                                Thus, a can with a radius of \(1.853\) \(\textrm{in.}\) and height \(3.707\) \(\textrm{in.}\) 
                                minimizes the cost of manufacturing while holding the required volume.

                        In some situations, minimizing or maximizing the square of a function is more convenient. 
                        If \(f(x)\) has a minimum or maximum at \(x = a,\) then so does \(\sqrt{f(x)}.\) 
                        This fact is useful in solving problems with square roots, such as in the context of distance.

                                Let us first draw a picture representing the situation, as shown by Figure 6,
                                and let \(d\) be this shortest distance. 
                                From the Distance Formula, 
                                \[d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2,}\]
                                we have \((x_1, y_1)\) \(= (0, 1)\) 
                                and \((x_2, y_2)\) \(= (x, x^2),\)
                                which is the point on the parabola.
                                Thus, we obtain
                                \[d = \sqrt{x^2 + (x^2 - 1)^2}.\]
                                Our goal now is to find the critical points of \(d.\) 
                                However, it is simplier to consider the square of the distance, \(d^2,\) 
                                as both functions have the same critical points. 
                                Let us reference \(d^2\) as the function 
                                \[q(x) = x^2 + (x^2 - 1)^2,\]
                                whose derivative is
                                \[q'(x) = 4x^3 - 2x.\]
                                Setting this expression equal to \(0\) gives
                                \[
                                \ba 
                                4x^3 - 2x &= 0 \\
                                2x(2x^2 - 1) &= 0 \implies \\
                                x &= 0 \\ 
                                x &= \frac{-1}{\sqrt 2} \\ 
                                x &= \frac{1}{\sqrt 2}.
                                \ea 
                                \]
                                Notice that, had we differentiated \(d,\) we would have gotten
                                \[d'(x) = \frac{2x(2x^2-1)}{\sqrt{x^4 - x^2 + 1}},\]
                                which has the same zeros as \(q'(x).\) 
                                These same solutions demonstrate that the critical numbers of \(d\) and \(d^2\) are the same, 
                                so considering \(d^2\) is more convenient. 
                            </p>

                            </div>
                            <p>
                                We now need to analyze these critical numbers. 
                                For \(x \lt 0,\) \(q' \lt 0;\) for \(x \gt 0,\) \(q' \gt 0.\)
                                Thus, \(x = 0\) corresponds to a relative maximum. 
                                We are interested in <i>minimizing</i> the distance, 
                                so we can ignore this critical number. 
                                Conversely, as you may verify, \(x = -1/\sqrt 2\) and \(x = 1/\sqrt 2\) both correspond to relative minima.
                                Because \(\lim_{x \to -\infty} d\) \(= \infty\) and \(\lim_{x \to \infty} d\) \(= \infty,\)  
                                the absolute minimum of \(d\) must lie at each of these relative minima. (See Figure 7.)
                                This result is intuitive because the graph of \(y = x^2\) is symmetrical with respect to \(x = 0,\) 
                                meaning that there are two points on the parabola for which \(d\) is minimized.

                                The word <i>inscribed</i> means that the rectangle has two vertices on the parabola and two vertices on the \(x\)-axis,
                                as shown by Figure 8. Thus, since the rectangle has length \(2x\) and height \(y,\) its area is

                                    <p>

                                However, we know that 
                                <div class="numbered-equations">
                                    <p>

                                Substituting equation \((2)\) into equation \((1)\) enables us to eliminate \(y\) 
                                and express \(A\) solely in terms of \(x\!:\)
                                \[A = xy = x(9 - x^2).\]
                                Finding the critical numbers of \(A(x),\) we get 
                                \[
                                \ba 
                                A'(x) = 9 - 3x^2 &= 0 \implies \\
                                x &= \sqrt 3 \\
                                x &= - \sqrt 3, \\

                                both of which are relative maxima by the First Derivative Test. 
                                Furthermore, the domain for \(A(x)\) is \(0 \leq x \leq 3,\)
                                and at each endpoint the area is \(0\) because the rectangle collapses into a line.
                                Thus, these relative maxima are absolute maxima.
                                \(x = -\sqrt 3\) corresponds to the point in the second quadrant, 
                                and \(x = \sqrt 3\) corresponds to the one in the first quadrant.
                                For these values, \(y = 6.\) 
                                Thus, a rectangle of length \(2 \sqrt 3\) and height \(6\) is the largest possible rectangle that can be inscribed.

                        Let us now discuss the applications of optimization in business, especially as they relate to maximizing profit. 
                        A firm's profit function, \(P(x),\) is defined by 
                        \[
                        \ba 
                        \textrm{profit} &= \textrm{revenue} - \textrm{cost} \\
                        P(x) &= R(x) - C(x),
                        \ea 
                        \]
                        where \(x\) is the number of units produced.
                        We will analyze cases in which a business's cost function is non-constant, since
                        in reality a firm needs to expand in order to produce a greater quantity of goods.
                        (You will see most cost functions with the property that \(\lim_{x \to \infty} c(x) = \infty\) for this reason; expansion is expensive.) 
                        <i>Revenue</i> is the amount of money generated by the firm before cost is considered, and it is expressed by
                        \[\textrm{revenue} = \textrm{quantity} \cdot \textrm{price}.\]
                        A firm's <i>marginal cost</i> is the cost of producing one additional unit. 
                        Thus, it can be modeled by the derivative of the cost function, or \(C'(x).\) 
                        A firm's <i>average cost</i> is defined by the cost divided by the quantity produced:
                        \[\overline{C}(x) = \frac{C(x)}{x}.\]
                        At the quantity \(x\) at which the cost function is minimized, 
                        it follows that the average cost function is also minimized and that the marginal cost function equals \(0.\)

                                &= -x^2 + 112x - 3000.

                                We now need to minimize \(P(x).\) 
                                Let us compute its derivative and find its critical numbers:
                                \[
                                \ba 
                                P'(x) = -2x + 112 &= 0\\ 
                                x &= 56. \\
                                \ea 
                                \]
                                For \(x \lt 56,\) \(P' > 0;\) for \(x \gt 56,\) \(P' \lt 0.\) 
                                Thus, the critical number corresponds to an absolute minimum. 
                                We also know that the domain of \(P(x)\) is \(x \geq 0,\) 
                                so we need to consider its behavior at \(x = 0\) and as \(x \to \infty.\)
                                At \(x = 0,\) \(P = -3000;\) as \(x \to \infty,\) \(P \to -\infty.\) 
                                From this analysis, \(P\) has a maximum value, and it must be found at the critical number, \(x = 56.\) 
                                Therefore, Isaiah should sell \(\boxed{56}\) hot dogs in order to maximize his profit. 
                                At this output level, his profit is \(P(56)\) \(= \boxed{136}\) dollars, 
                                and his average cost is \(\overline{C}(56)\) \(= C(56)/56\) \(= \boxed{9.571}\) dollars per hot dog.

                                We need to write an expression for the revenue from eyeliner sales.
                                Let \(R(x)\) be the revenue function, where \(x\) is the increment of the price in dollars. 
                                For every \(\$2\) increase, the price is \((10 + 2x)\) and the quantity of pencils sold is \((40 - 4x).\)
                                Revenue is the product of quantity and price, so we have
                                \[
                                \ba 
                                \textrm{revenue} &= \textrm{quantity} \cdot \textrm{price} \\ 
                                R(x) &= (40 - 4x)(10 + 2x) \\
                                &= -8x^2 + 40x + 400.
                                \ea

                                We must find the maximum of this revenue expression, so let us find its critical numbers:
                                \[
                                \ba 
                                R'(x) = -16x + 40 &= 0 \\
                                x &= \frac{40}{16} = 2.5.
                                \ea

                                Thus, the First Derivative Test states that \(x = 2.5\) corresponds to a relative maximum of \(R(x).\)
                                Additionally, the domain of \(R(x)\) is \(x \geq 0,\) so we need to consider \(R(0)\) and its behavior as \(x \to \infty \!:\)
                                <ul>

                                        \(R(0) = 400.\)
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        \(R(2.5) = 450.\)

                                    <li>
                                        \(\ds \lim_{x \to \infty} R(x) = -\infty.\)

                                </ul>
                                From these candidates, \(x = 2.5\) corresponds to the absolute maximum of \(R(x).\) 
                                Therefore, the store should raise the price of the eyeliner pencil by \(\boxed{\$2.5.}\)

                        The following examples are complex problems that require calculators, so we will only concern ourselves with the setup.
                        You should graph the function on a calculator to verify that a solution corresponds to an absolute extremum.
                        Additionally, some of the exercises for this section do not contain in-depth explanations for why a quantity is an absolute extremum;
                        you should be able to provide a justification yourself or graph the function.

                            A lifeguard on the shoreline rushes to assist a drowning swimmer
                            located \(20\) feet east from the lifeguard and \(8\) feet from the shoreline.
                            The lifeguard can run at \(10\) feet per second and swim at \(6\) feet per second.
                            She runs a distance \(x\) before jumping into the water and swimming to the drowning person, 
                            as shown by Figure 9. 
                            At what distance \(x\) should the lifeguard enter the water in order to minimize the time to rescue the swimmer?
                            (Note: Figure not drawn to scale.) (Calculator required.)

                                We need to derive an expression for the time, \(t,\) that the lifeguard takes to rescue the swimming person.
                                The distance that she runs is \(x,\) and the distance that she swims is \(\sqrt{(20 - x)^2 + 64}.\)
                                We understand that 
                                \[\textrm{time} = \frac{\textrm{distance}}{\textrm{speed}}. \]
                                The lifeguard's speed is \(10\) feet per second onshore and \(6\) feet per second in water. 
                                Therefore, the lifeguard's time for the first part of the trip, running onshore, is   
                                \[t_1 = \frac{x}{10}.\]
                                Her time for the second part of the trip, swimming, is 
                                \[t_2 = \frac{\sqrt{(20 - x)^2 + 64}}{6}. \]
                                Her total time, \(t,\) is the sum of these times:
                                \[
                                \ba 
                                t &= t_1 + t_2 \\
                                &= \frac{x}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{(20 - x)^2 + 64}}{6}.

                                This expression is solely in terms of \(x,\) so we can differentiate to locate its critical numbers:
                                \[

                                The relative minimum is the location of the absolute minimum, as shown by the graph of \(y = t(x)\) (Figure 10).

                                To obtain the expression for the total amount of wire required, 
                                we need to find the amount of wire needed from the anchor to the top of each tower.
                                For the \(15 \; \textrm{m}\) tower, let \(x\) be the distance from the base of the power to the anchor point. 
                                It then follows that the amount of wire needed is 
                                \[w_1 = \sqrt{x^2 + 15^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 225}. \]
                                For the \(10 \; \textrm{m}\) tower, the distance from the anchor point to its base is \(30 - x.\)
                                The amount of wire needed is then 
                                \[w_2 = \sqrt{(30 - x)^2 + 10^2} = \sqrt{x^2 - 60x + 1000}.\] 
                                Therefore, the total amount of wire required is 
                                \[
                                \ba 
                                w &= w_1 + w_2 \\ 
                                &= \sqrt{x^2 + 225} + \sqrt{x^2 - 60x + 1000}. 
                                \ea 
                                \]
                                Finding its derivative and equating it to \(0\) give 
                                \[
                                \ba 
                                \frac{\dd w}{\dd x} = \frac{x - 30}{\sqrt{x^2 - 60x + 1000}} + \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 225}} &= 0 \implies \\
                                x &= 18.
                                \ea 
                                \]
                                This critical number corresponds to the absolute minimum of \(w.\)
                                Thus, the optimal spot to anchor the wires is \(18\) meters right of the \(15 \; \textrm{m}\) tower.
